## Task 2
The aim of the tasks is to demonstrate an understanding of hyperlinks, as covered in the Creating hyperlinks lesson in Learn Web Development on MDN.
> ### In this task we want you to fill in the four links so that they link to the appropriate places:
> - [X] The first link should link to an image called blue-whale.jpg, which is located in a directory called blue inside the current directory.
> - [X] The second link should link to an image called narwhal.jpg, which is located in a directory called narwhal, which is located one directory level above the current directory.
> - [X] The third link should link to the UK Google Image search. The base URL is https://www.google.co.uk, and the image search is located in a subdirectory called imghp.
> - [X] The fourth link should link to the paragraph at the very bottom of the current page. It has an ID of bottom.
