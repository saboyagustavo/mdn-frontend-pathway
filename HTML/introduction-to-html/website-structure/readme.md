# Document and website structure
_MDN Web Docs Learning Pathway to Front-End Development_
[Lesson](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure) |  [MDN Solution](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/master/html/introduction-to-html/document_and_website_structure)
The aim of this practice was learn how to structure documents using semantic tags, and how to work out the structure of a simple website.
## Feature 1
### Layout and functionalities explained:
> "In your HTML code, you can mark up sections of content based on their functionality â€” you can use elements that represent the sections of content described above unambiguously, and assistive technologies like screenreaders can recognise those elements and help with tasks like "find the main navigation", or "find the main content." As we mentioned earlier in the course, **there are a number of consequences of not using the right element structure and semantics for the right job**."

## Challenge 
> - []  Give class names and style properly the example as the layout.
> - []  Make my own sitemap.
