Objectives: Test basic and advanced HTML text formatting, use of hyperlinks, and use of HTML < head >.
## Brief
For this project, my task is to mark up a fictitious letter that needs to be hosted on a university intranet. The letter is a response from a research fellow to a prospective PhD student concerning their application to the university.

## Tasks
> ###  Block/structural semantics 
> - [x] Use appropriate document structure including doctype, and <html>, <head> and <body> elements.
> - [x] In general, the letter should be marked up as an organization of headings and  paragraphs, with the following exception. There is one top level heading (the "Re:" line) and three second level headings.
> - [x] Use an appropriate list type to mark up the semester start dates, study subjects, and exotic dances.
> - [x] Put the two addresses inside <address> elements. Each line of the address should sit on a new line, but not be in a new paragraph.
> ### Inline semantics
> - [x] The names of the sender and receiver (and Tel and Email) should be marked up with strong importance.
> - [x] The four dates in the document should be have appropriate elements containing machine-readable dates.
> - [x] The first address and first date in the letter should have a class attribute value of sender-column. The CSS you'll add later will cause these to be right aligned, as it should be in the case in a classic letter layout.
> - [x] Mark up the five acronyms/abbreviations in the main text of the letter to provide expansions of each acronym/abbreviation.
> - [x] The six sub/superscripts should be marked up appropriately â€” in the chemical formulae,  and the numbers 103 and 104 (they should be 10 to the power of 3 and 4, respectively).
> - [x] Try to mark up at least two appropriate words in the text with strong importance/emphasis.
> - [x] There are two places where the letter should have a hyperlink. Add appropriate links with titles. For the location that the links point to, you may use http://example.com as the URL.
> - [x] Mark up the university motto quote and citation with appropriate elements.
> ###  The head of the document
> - [x] The character set of the document should be set as utf-8 using the appropriate meta tag.
> - [x] The author of the letter should be specified in an appropriate meta tag.
> - [x] The provided CSS should be included inside an appropriate tag. (I did preferred to link in a separate document style.css)
