### Active Learning: Playing with SVG :heavy_check_mark: 

> In this active learning section we'd like you to have a go at playing with some SVG for fun. In the *Input* section below you'll see that we've already provided you with some samples to get you started. You can also go to the [SVG Element Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element), find out more details about other toys you can use in SVG, and try  those out too. This section is all about practising your research  skills, and having some fun.
