## Challenge
> ### Task 1 
> In this task we want you to **embed a simple image of some Blueberries into the page**. You need to: 
> - [] Add the path to the image to an appropriate attribute to embed it on the page. The image is called blueberries.jpg, and it is in a folder inside the current folder called images.
> - [] Add some alternative text to an appropriate attribute to describe the image, for people that cannot see it.
> - [] Give the ``<img>`` element an appropriate width and height so that it displays at the correct aspect ratio, and enough space is left on the page to display it. **The image's intrinsic size is 615 x 419 pixels**.
