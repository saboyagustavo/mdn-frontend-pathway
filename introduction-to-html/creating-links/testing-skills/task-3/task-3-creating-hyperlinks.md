## Task 3
The aim of the tasks is to demonstrate an understanding of hyperlinks, as covered in the Creating hyperlinks lesson in Learn Web Development on MDN.
> ### In this task we want you to:
> - [] Take the existing paragraphs with poorly-written link text, and rewrite them so that they have good link text.
> - []     Add a warning to any links that need a warning added.
### How the test start

### The result I'd desire
- [] Plan a layout for this page
- [] Mix this page with the page from the "task 1" and "task 2" (since all these are fictitious content about whales)
- [] Style the page as the I planned in the layout
