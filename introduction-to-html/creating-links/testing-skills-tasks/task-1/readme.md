[Lesson](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks) | [Task](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Test_your_skills:_Links) [MDN Solution](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/introduction-to-html/tasks/links/marking.md)
## Task 1
The aim of the tasks is to demonstrate an understanding of hyperlinks, as covered in the Creating hyperlinks lesson in Learn Web Development on MDN.
### In this task we want you to help fill in the links on our Whales information page:
- [] The first link should be linked to a page called whales.html, which is in the same directory as the current page.- [] We'd also like you to give it a tooltip when moused over that tells the user that the page includes information on Blue Whales and Sperm Whales.
- [] The second link should be turned into a link you can click to open up an email in the user's default mail application, with the recipient set as "whales@example.com".
- [] You'll get a bonus point if you also set it so that the subject line of the email is automatically filled in as "Question about Whales".
