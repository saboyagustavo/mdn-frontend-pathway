    Basic HTML Animals

    This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.
    
    The Llama
    
    Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.
    
    The Anaconda
    
    The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.
