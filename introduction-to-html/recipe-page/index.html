    <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>
    <p>
        This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes
        that I have read over the years.
    </p>

    <h2>Hummus: a delicious thick paste.</h2>
    <p>
        Used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes, it is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.
    </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
        <li>175g of tahini</li>
        <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
        <li>Half a red pepper</li>
        <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
        <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
        <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
        <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste</li>
        <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
        <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime
        and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese.
        <br>
        Experiment and see what works for you.
    </p>

    <h4>Storage</h4>
    <p>
        Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container.
        <br>
        You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should
        definitely discard it. Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
