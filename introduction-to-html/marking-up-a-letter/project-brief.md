Objectives: Test basic and advanced HTML text formatting, use of hyperlinks, and use of HTML < head >.
## Brief
For this project, my task is to mark up a fictitious letter that needs to be hosted on a university intranet. The letter is a response from a research fellow to a prospective PhD student concerning their application to the university.

## Tasks
> ###  Block/structural semantics 
> - [x] Use appropriate document structure including doctype, and <html>, <head> and <body> elements.
> - [] In general, the letter should be marked up as an organization of headings and  paragraphs, with the following exception. There is one top level heading (the "Re:" line) and three second level headings.
> - [] Use an appropriate list type to mark up the semester start dates, study subjects, and exotic dances.
> - [x] Put the two addresses inside <address> elements. Each line of the address should sit on a new line, but not be in a new paragraph.
